### SOLID principles - Python

#### SRP - The Single-responsibility principle (SRP)
“A class should have one, and only one, reason to change”
    

#### OCP - The Open–closed principle (OCP)
“Software entities … should be open for extension but closed for modification”

#### LCP - The Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
“Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it”

#### ICP - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
“Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface”


#### DIP - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP
“Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions”
